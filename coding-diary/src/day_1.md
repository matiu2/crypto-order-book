# Day 1

## Hour 1 - Saturday 16 April 4:46-5:28

 * Read the challenge
 * Consider existing libraries for binance:
   + [binance-rs](https://github.com/wisespace-io/binance-rs) - Most recently updated (3 months ago) - personal project - **not async**
   + [binance_api_async](https://github.com/bigbizze/binance_api_async) - A lot more docos. Probably more than we need for the challenge - only support nightly rust due to [this line](https://github.com/bigbizze/binance_api_async/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L1)
     - I got something working in [experiment_1](./binance/experiment_1/src/main.rs)  working, but I prefer not to use nightly, and not to modify 3rd party libraries.
 * Consider websocket libraries
 * Read the [binance API reference](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/web-socket-streams.md)
 * [Joined the discord](https://discord.com/channels/677525364829978625/677525365366980620)
 * Mucked around with the [example binance api](https://api.binance.com/api/v3/depth?symbol=ETHBTC)
